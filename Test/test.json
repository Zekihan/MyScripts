Short skirt and and boob window aside, she's way out of Dongsoo's league. But, that all changes when an accident on the train embues Dongsoo and some other passengers on the train with a thousand years worth of sexual spiritual energy. The thing is, there's only one way to release the energy. Time to hang out with your yang out.",

He quickly plummets back down to earth, however, upon discovering that he&rsquo;s been saddled with an immense amount of debt. There is, however, one way he can keep his creditors at bay: become &ldquo;friends&rdquo; with an enigmatic and alluring girl named Kanoko. The task sounds simple enough at first, but leaves him eating his own words as Kanoko&rsquo;s selfish demands start to take their toll on him both mentally and physically. Will Shin ever be able to pay his debt off, or will the lust, luxury, and mystery simply overwhelm him??",

So when the boy hears that making a wish to the school's Obtuse God can make a romance come true, he asks that his closet becomes a portal to Subaru's room and that she'll walk through it &ndash; and then she does, naked! The Obtuse God then appears and informs them that since they both wished for the same thing, it was granted &ndash; but the price to be paid is an hour per day of Subaru's self control! Now, this tsundere-to-the-extreme girl spends time each day revealing her true feelings for Akira, begging for his loins and fluids at every turn. How will Akira cope with this new relationship?",

At night, she dresses herself up and becomes the glamorous call girl Miyabi. She doesn't just do it for the money; she loves the pleasure and happiness she can bring to her customers.It seems like this double life can't last forever, though. Her chubby friend Aki, who spends her time desperately dieting in order to attract a man, doesn't understand why Masami is so opposed to getting a boyfriend. Her other classmates, the perverted Kaneko and the rich Sasaki Kaori, have opposing views of the acceptability of the pleasure industries. What will happen if the people who know Masami during the day discover the secret existence of the lovely Miyabi?",

She's Miyauchi Misao, and she wakes him up every morning, hangs all over him all the time, and generally follows him around like a loyal puppy. It's started to get a bit awkward now that they're in high school, and she's a bit more... womanly... than she was when they were children. Everyone at school just assumes they're dating, so it's killing Yuusuke's chances with the ladies. One day Yuusuke has a shock waiting for him; Misao has gotten engaged. She says that she's set to be married in spring, but she seems comfortable hanging all over Yuusuke in the meantime. The unfamiliar jealousy that the news has awoken in Yuusuke has spurred him on to making his own plans. He's going to try to become popular, and get a girlfriend, before Misao gets married in the spring.",

It's gotten to the point that she'll claim to feel bad during class, so she can run to the nurse's office and masturbate. When she learns that the Earth is being invaded by aliens that look like people dressed up as animals, it turns out her high sex drive may be able to help protect the Earth. The first time Izumi is attacked by the aliens, she is rescued by Usayama, a bunny alien whose race was their previous victim. Usayama gives her an outfit (a sexy swimsuit) that will allow her to fight the aliens, but which also sends her constant arousal through the roof. The scientific organization that Usayama is affiliated with think that Izumi, with her high erotic level, may be the person they've been looking for to fight the aliens. Will Izumi be able to save the Earth?&nbsp;",
